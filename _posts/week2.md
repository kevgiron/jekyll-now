  Hello all my name is Kevin I am a senior member of security at Miro Labs Inc. Today I will be discussing potential implementations that can make our security program as robust as we can make it. As an organization we should periodically review the effectiveness of our existing security controls. We should review all aspects of security, including security training, device configuration and policies and procedures. I believe that our first order of business should start with a Gap Analysis: a Gap Analysis compares an organization’s security program to overall best security practices. By comparing these best practices to actual practices, security professionals can determine where vulnerabilities and risks are lurking. Which can ensure that our organization’s network, staff, and security controls are robust and cost efficient.

Next I believe that our organization preform both a Key performance indicators (KPI) and key risk indicators (KRI).  This will serve as a performance indicator is a metric that informs us how we are doing and tells us what to do and what action to take. KPIs track things that directly relate to specific actions or activities. The KPI figures that we need to capture are: the amount of time for incident resolution, downtime during an incident, calculation of cost per incident, and the number of small and large security incidents reported. As for our KRI's we use this to manage how risky an activity is or how likely a risk is to occur. We can use them as early signals of particular risks that may occur. The KRI's that we need to capture are the acceleration of high severity events. Handle time, how long does it take you to identify a threat and eliminate the cause of that threat? Attack surface area. how many hosts are involved in a security event? How many hosts are included in an attack?

Availability is one of our greatest key players, availability is the amount or percentage of time a computer system is available for use. Availability is best determined by looking at the component within the security solution that is most likely to fail. Knowing how long a solution can be down, how long it will take to repair, and the amount of time between failures are all important components in determining availability.

Next recoverability, recoverability is the probability that if by chance we have afailed security solution our devices can be restored to its normal operable state within a given time frame, using the prescribed practices and procedures. Recoverability is best determined by researching the actions that will need to be taken if a partial or full recovery of the security solution or device is required. Knowing how long the recovery will take is an important component when choosing between different security solutions or devices.

Lastly we meed to look at total cost of ownership (TCO)  to measures the overall costs associated with securing our organization, including insurance premiums, finance costs, administrative costs, and any losses that we may incur  This value should be compared to the overall company revenues and asset base.
