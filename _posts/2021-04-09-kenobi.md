## Week 11 Lab: Kenobi

<dl>
  <dt>Task 1</dt>
  <dd>This room covered accessing a Samba share, manipulating a vulnerable version of proftpd to gain initial access and escalate your privileges to root via an SUID binary</dd>
  <dd> scan the machine with nmap and find 7 open ports </dd>
  <dt>Task 2</dt>
  <dd>Using nmap we can enumerate a machine for SMB shares</dd>
  <dd> after running nmap we can find 3 open ports, then once connected we can find log.txt and can find that FTP is running on port 21</dd>
  <dt>Task 3</dt>
  <dd> Use netcat to connect to the machine on the FTP port. we find that we are running 1.3.5</dd>
 
  <dd>We then use searchsploit to find exploits for a particular software version.</dd>
  <dd>Their are 3 exploits </dd>
 
  <dd>mkdir /mnt/kenobiNFS mount machine_ip:/var /mnt/kenobiNFS ls -la /mnt/kenobiNFS

We now have a network mount on our deployed machine. We then can go to /var/tmp and get the private key then login to Kenobi's account.

What is Kenobi's user flag (/home/kenobi/user.txt)? ---->d0b0f3f53b6caa532a83915e19224899

  <dt>Task 4</dt>
  <dd>To search the a system for these type of files run the following: find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null

What file looks particularly out of the ordinary?</dd>
 
  <dd>/usr/bin/menu</dd>
 
  <dd>Run the binary, how many options appear?</dd>

  <dd>3</dd>
 
  <dd>Strings is a command on Linux that looks for human readable strings on a binary.



This shows us the binary is running without a full path (e.g. not using /usr/bin/curl or /usr/bin/uname).

As this file runs as the root users privileges, we can manipulate our path gain a root shell.</dd>

  <dd>What is the root flag (/root/root.txt)?</dd>
